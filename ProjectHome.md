The game was written during June, July & August 2012 from scratch with the exception of the sprite rotation code which was taken from TankorSmash's tutorial page.

The game is the second I've wrote, the first being Hangman+.

The idea behind the game was for a more realistic top down racing game where finding the quickest racing line is key rather than power sliding around corners. The original plan was for multiple racers and AI but I'd rather release the current version based on lap timing / ghost laps and get some feedback before spending months more time on it.

Hints & Tips
The faster bikes accelerate slower and take longer to slow down for corners. You are best starting with Bike 1 and learning the tracks before moving onto the faster bikes. On the slower, technical tracks boosting out of corners is the key to the fastest laptimes. Also try not to hold boost down too long - many short bursts of boost give you a quicker overall time as your bike takes a while to drop from the boosted top speed. You are allowed to clip corners but if you are on the grass for more than 0.5 seconds over the lap then your lap time is invalidated. You only get a ghost bike once a valid lap has been completed.

Skidmarks / Revised bike handling added in version 0.82

Future plans
Particle effects
Recording of ghost laps

Network / multiplayer

The lap time files would need some kind of cheat prevention if the game takes off but I'm not planning that far ahead yet!

I'd appreciate any comments or help regarding the bugs in code, and of course the time you've taken to download and play the game - I hope you enjoy it.
